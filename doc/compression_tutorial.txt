RATE CONTROL
to optimize perceived pic quality and achieve given constant avg bit rate.
VBR:
CBR:

1.  Bit Allocation
need to estimate # bits available, based on
-picture type
-buffer size
-picture complexity (# bits & quantization param used for coding same type of previous pic in GOP)

2.  Rate Control
a. bits used for each macroblock determined by rate control algo
b. quantizer step derived from available bits for macroblock
